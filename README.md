# Aster Mail

Aster Mail is a free, open-source, end-to-end encrypted mail service. Every message subject line and attachment is encrypted locally on your device. This means we have no way to read your email and we never will.

You can sign up at [astermail.org](https://astermail.org). A phone number and recovery email are not required.
## How it works

All Aster-to-Aster messages are end-to-end encrypted using the standard OpenPGP (RSA-4096). Subject lines are also encrypted. This means that we cannot read your subject lines, unlike other providers. Aster-to-Aster messages also use ML-KEM-768 inside an X3DH/Double Ratchet protocol, this provides complete post-quantum protection. 

Your keys are yours, and they are fully portable. You can export them and use them with any compatible PGP client, such as Thunderbird or GPG. Public keys are published via WKD and key servers automatically, so encrypting to other Aster users just works. 

Aster runs a zero-access architecture system that is located in Germany. This means we store nothing we could hand over, even if we were compelled.
